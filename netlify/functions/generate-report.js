        # Report Structure & Instructions

        ## Innovation Focus
        - Type of Innovation = ${productType}
        - Ingredients = ${ingredients}
        - Region Focus = ${region}

        ---

        NOTE - VERY IMPORTANT
        1. If a single ingredients is selected then use that one ingredient for the analysis.
        2. IF Two or more ingredients are combined then evaluate by combining 2 or more ingredients selected.
        3. Each analysis should focus on the local region based on the country selected. If global then it will be a general analysis.

        SECTION 1 : GENERAL LANDSCAPE
        Research and write up 5 prominent headlines.

        SECGTION 2 : INGREDIENT Digital Market Strength
        - For the ingredient or combined ingredients selected:
          - Total social media mentions within past 12 months
          - Overall sentiment (positive %, neutral %, negative %)
          - Strength of single Ingredient or multiple ingredients combined combo - If more than 1500 mentions within past 12 months then strong.
          - Platforms analyzed (Analyze and write for each platform):
        TikTok
        Instagram
        Twitter
        Reddit
        Facebook
        Forums
        Trend-Based Websites
        Other Sources

        Include citations where possible (e.g., TikTok, Statista, Reddit thread, Google Trends, etc.)


        SECTION 3 - Cross-Platform Trend Insights (Last 12 Months)
        Summarize 5 most prominent trends across the platforms above.
        Use bullets. Keep it quantitative and focused on emerging consumer preferences.

        SECTION 4 - Existing Market Landscape
        - List 2â€“3 existing snack/beverage products that exists which have the ingredients.
        - Show sales, market size or estimated units if available for each product
        - Add sources or benchmarks (Statista, Mintel, public reports, or GPT-generated reference estimate)


        SECTION 5 - High-Strength Innovation Opportunities
        Generate 5 unique ideas (new concepts)

        VERY IMPPRTANT.
        FOR EACH IDEA SHOW THE BELOW INFORMATION WITHIN EACH CONCEPT. EACH CONCEPT SHOULD HAVE SECTION A TO SECTION D.

        Section A
        - Product Name + Description
        - Estimated annual unit sales by segment. Validate why the estimates could be accurate. We need to provide fact based valid information. If cannot find fact based information then answer NA.

          | Segment       | Est. Units/Year |
          |--------------|-----------------|
          | Gen Alpha    |                 |
          | Gen Z        |                 |

    try {
        const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
        const response = await result.response;
        const text = response.text();

        // The 'text' contains the full report, including image URLs.
